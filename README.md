# 🌐 VNeeds – Turn your hostel needs into quick deals, anytime, anywhere 🚀  

> A student-to-student marketplace built to make hostel life simpler – buy, sell, and find essentials in seconds.  

---

## ✨ About  
We ([@urmi272](https://github.com/urmi272) & [@anjalisevkani](https://github.com/anjalisevkani)) realized how **students often sell and buy items informally through WhatsApp groups** – but it’s messy, hard to search, and prices/availability are unclear.  

So we built **VNeeds** – a clean, student-focused marketplace to:  
- Discover items instantly  
- Buy & sell with transparent prices  
- Avoid the chaos of group chats  

---

## 🚀 Features
- 🛍️ **Buy & Sell Products** with name, description, price, category & image  
- ❤️ **Wishlist** items for later  
- 🔍 **Search & Filter** by category and price  
- 🌙 **Dark Mode Toggle** for better usability  
- 📱 **Responsive Design** – works on mobile & desktop  
- 👤 **User Profile Section** with email & avatar initials  
- ✨ **Modern UI** with expressive product cards and smooth animations  
- 📦 **Local Storage Persistence** (data saved across sessions)
