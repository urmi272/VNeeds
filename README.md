## ✨ About  
We ([@urmi272](https://github.com/urmi272) & [@anjalisevkani](https://github.com/anjalisevkani)) realized how **students often sell and buy items informally through WhatsApp groups** – but it’s messy, hard to search, and prices/availability are unclear.  

So we built **VNeeds** – a clean, student-focused marketplace to:  
- Discover items instantly  
- Buy & sell with transparent prices  
- Avoid the chaos of group chats
